<b> HatsuneMix-ue: Tubes 2 Aljabar Lanjar dan Geometri </b>

- README and Additional Notes to us

Setup Instructions
-------------------

1. Navigate to the Project Directory  
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd ./src/frontend/Hatsune_Mixue/
   ```

2. Install Dependencies  
   Ensure all required packages are installed by running:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the Development Server  
   Run the development server with:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Additional Notes
----------------

- Pre-requisites:
  - Ensure you have Node.js installed (version `16.x` or higher is recommended).
  - Verify that npm is available by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
- Environment Variables:
  - If your project requires any API keys or environment variables, make sure to set them up in a `.env` file within the project root directory. (Check `.env.example` if available.)
- Access the Application:
  - Once the server starts, open your browser and go to the URL displayed in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

Optional Improvements
---------------------

1. Add a Script to Simplify Setup
   Create a `setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `setup.bat` (Windows) script to automate the process:
   - Example `setup.sh`:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     cd ./src/frontend/Hatsune_Mixue/ || exit
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Example `setup.bat` (Windows):
     ```cmd
     cd .\src\frontend\Hatsune_Mixue\
     npm install
     npm run dev
     ```

   Then instruct users to run `./setup.sh` (Linux/macOS) or `setup.bat` (Windows) for setup.

2. Dockerize the Application  
   Use Docker to containerize your application so users donâ€™t need to worry about dependencies:
   - Create a `Dockerfile`:
     ```dockerfile
     FROM node:16
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY ./src/frontend/Hatsune_Mixue/ .
     RUN npm install
     CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
     ```
   - Add a `docker-compose.yml` file for easy startup:
     ```yaml
     version: '3.8'
     services:
       hatsune_mixue:
         build: .
         ports:
           - "3000:3000"
     ```
   Users can then run:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. Improve Documentation  
   Include a `README.md` with detailed setup, troubleshooting tips, and contribution guidelines.
